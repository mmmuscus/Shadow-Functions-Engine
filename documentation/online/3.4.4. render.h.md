###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
This header contains functions that either help rendering, or actually render stuff.
#### 3.4.4.1. goTo
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function puts the cursor in a set position on the console window.
//   The working of this function can be found in the link below as the fourth answer:
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10401724/move-text-cursor-to-particular-screen-coordinate
void goTo (int row, int column)
{
	HANDLE hStdout;
	hStdout = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
	
	COORD destCoord;
	
	destCoord.X = column;
	destCoord.Y = row;
	
	SetConsoleCursorPosition(hStdout, destCoord);
}
```
**Usage:** This function puts the cursor into a set position in the console window.

**Variables:**
* **row:** The row of the cell to which the cursor will be put on the console window.
* **col:** The column of the cell to which the cursor will be put on the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** This was one of the three times where I resorted to outside sources to solve a problem. I found my answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10401724/move-text-cursor-to-particular-screen-coordinate) in the fourth answer.

#### 3.4.4.2. clearScreen
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function clears the console window.
//   The workings of this function can be found at this link:
// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/clearing-the-screen
void clearScreen()
{
	HANDLE hConsole;
	hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);	

	COORD coordScreen = { 0, 0 };
	DWORD cCharsWritten;
	CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO csbi; 
	DWORD dwConSize;

    // Get the number of character cells in the current buffer. 

	if( !GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo( hConsole, &csbi ))
		return;
	dwConSize = csbi.dwSize.X * csbi.dwSize.Y;

	// Fill the entire screen with blanks.

	if( !FillConsoleOutputCharacter( hConsole, (TCHAR) ' ',
    	dwConSize, coordScreen, &cCharsWritten ))
    	return;

	// Get the current text attribute.

	if( !GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo( hConsole, &csbi ))
    	return;

	// Set the buffer's attributes accordingly.

	if( !FillConsoleOutputAttribute( hConsole, csbi.wAttributes,
    	dwConSize, coordScreen, &cCharsWritten ))
    	return;

	// Put the cursor at its home coordinates.

	SetConsoleCursorPosition( hConsole, coordScreen );
}
```
**Usage:** Clears the console window. 

**Variables:** -

**How it's done & notes:** This was one of the three times where I resorted to outside sources to solve my problem. Sadly I lost the original link, but I found this implementation of a clear screen function right [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/clearing-the-screen)!

#### 3.4.4.3. renderConsole
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function renders the console array onto the console window.
void renderConsole(char oldC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS], char newC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS])
{
	//   First the function loops through all of the variables in the array.
	for (int i = 0; i < CONSOLEROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < CONSOLECOLS; j++)
		{
			//   We check if the variable we are on is different in the pervious frame,
			// if it is we go to the correct cell on the console window adn write the
			// variable from the current frame onto the window.
			if (newC[i][j] != oldC[i][j])
			{
				goTo(i, j);
				cout<<newC[i][j];
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Usage:** This renders the current frame onto the console window.

**Variables:**
* **oldC:** This array holds the textures from the last frame of the console window.
* **newC:** This array holds the textures from this frame of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through both of the arrays and compares each cell's textures. If there is a difference, it goes to the correct cell of the console window with [the goTo function](#3441-goto), and updates the cell with the correct texture. This means that the engine only updates cells that's texture changed in this frame, if the engine would update every cell every frame that would lead to flashing, sometimes not even completing the updates properly and (obviously) a much slower runtime.

#### 3.4.4.4. clearConsole
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
void clearConsole(char newC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS], char oldC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < CONSOLEROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < CONSOLECOLS; j++)
		{
			newC[i][j] = ' ';
			oldC[i][j] = 'x';
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This function primes [the oldConsole](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.3.%20Variables%20in%20the%20main%20.cpp%20file.md/#3314-oldconsole) and [newConsole](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.3.%20Variables%20in%20the%20main%20.cpp%20file.md/#3315-newconsole) arrays to render a blank screen the next time [the renderConsole function](#3443-renderconsole) is called.

**Variables:**

* **oldC:** This array gets filled up with a character that isn't a ' '.
* **newC:** This array gets filled up with ' ' characters.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through both of the arrays and fills them up with either an 'x' (if its the oldC) or a ' ' (if its the newC). The reason for this is that [the renderConsole function](#3443-renderconsole) only writes into the correct cell of the console window if the correct character in [the oldConsole](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.3.%20Variables%20in%20the%20main%20.cpp%20file.md/#3314-oldconsole) and [newConsole](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.3.%20Variables%20in%20the%20main%20.cpp%20file.md/#3315-newconsole) arrays differs. Thus the next time [renderConsole](#3443-renderconsole) is called it will "clear" the console window.

#### 3.4.4.5. calculateScreen
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
void calculateScreen(map world[WORLDROWS][WORLDCOLS], char screen[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS], int cameraRow, int cameraCol)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < CONSOLEROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < SCREENCOLS; j++)
		{
			if (world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].mapInView)
			{
				screen[i][j] = world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].texture;
			}
			else
			{
				if (world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].mapIsEdge)
				{
						screen[i][j] = char(176);
				}
				else
				{
					screen[i][j] = char(178);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This function translates all of the information calculated by the [shadowFunction](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.4.5.%20shadowFunctions.h.md/#34514-shadowfunction) and [mapIsEdgeCalculation](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.4.5.%20shadowFunctions.h.md/#34517-mapisedgecalculation) functions into textures that can be rendered.

**Variables:**
* **world:** This array holds all of the information about the cells of the world, like what is or isn't visible, etc.
* **screen:** This array will hold the textures of the console window after the function is finished.
* **cameraRow:** This is the value that holds in which row the camera is currently.
* **cameraCol:** This is the value that holds in which column the camera is currently.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through a part of the map that is equal in size to the "screen" part of the console window. Then if the cell of the world is not in view the texture of the cell on the screen becomes '▓'. If the cell of the world is in the edge, the texture of the cell on the screen becomes '░', and if neither of those are true the texture of the cell on the screen becomes the texture of the cell on the world.
