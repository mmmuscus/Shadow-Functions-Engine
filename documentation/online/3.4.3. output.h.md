### 3.4.3. [output.h](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/headers/output/output.h)
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
This header file contains [the function that makes rendering smoother and the game run faster](#3431-savelastconsolearray) and other functions that initialize the information from the different editors. I don't know why I named it output, but its too late now!

#### 3.4.3.1. saveLastConsoleArray
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function copies a console array into another console array.
void saveLastConsoleArray(char oldC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS], char newC[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS])
{
	//   The function loops through all the values in the array and copies all of them
	// from one array to another.
	for (int i = 0; i < CONSOLEROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < CONSOLECOLS; j++)
		{
			oldC[i][j] = newC[i][j];
		}
	}
}
```

**Usage:** This function saves the textures from the last frame of the console window.

**Variables:** 

* **oldC:** This array will hold the textures from the last frame of the console window.

* **newC:** This array currently holds the textures from the last frame of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops over every variable of the arrays and saves the information from the newC array into the oldC array. With this information the engine will run much smoother and faster since we only need to update cells that actually changed since the last frame.

#### 3.4.3.2. initSolid
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function initializes all the characters that block light.
void initSolid(char solide[SOLIDCOUNT], string fileName)
{
	//   First the function opens the file.
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	//   Next the function loops through all the characters in the .txt file and reads
	// them in.
	for (int i = 0; i < SOLIDCOUNT; i++)
	{
		fbe>>solide[i];
	}
	
	//   Lastly the function closes the .txt file.
	fbe.close();
}
```
**Usage:** This function gets all of the characters loaded from [the solid.txt](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt), these characters block light and thus create shadow.

**Variables:**
* **solide:** This array will hold all of the characters that block light.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the solid.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** The function opens and reads [the solid.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt). [SOLIDCOUNT](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.%20Description%20of%20EVERYTHING%20and%203.1.%20Defines.md/#314-solidcount-and-walkablecount) determines how many of the characters from the file the function loops through. For more information about the solid material editor click [here](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/2.2.%20How%20to%20use%20the%20editors%2C%20and%20other%20further%20details.md/#222-how-to-use-the-material-editors).
#### 3.4.3.3. initWalkable
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function initializes all the characters that don't block player movement.
void initWalkable(char walkablee[WALKABLECOUNT], string fileName)
{
	//   First the function opens the file.
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	//   Next the function loops through all the characters in the .txt file and reads
	// them in.
	for (int i = 0; i < WALKABLECOUNT; i++)
	{
		fbe>>walkablee[i];
	}
	
	//   Lastly the function closes the .txt file.
	fbe.close();
}
```
**Usage:** This function gets all of the characters loaded from [the walkable.txt](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt), these characters don't block player movement.

**Variables:**
* **solide:** This array will hold all of the characters that don't block player movement.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the walkable.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** The function opens and reads [the walkable.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt). [WALKABLECOUNT](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.%20Description%20of%20EVERYTHING%20and%203.1.%20Defines.md/#314-solidcount-and-walkablecount) determines how many of the characters from the file the function loops through. For more information about the walkable material editor click [here](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/2.2.%20How%20to%20use%20the%20editors%2C%20and%20other%20further%20details.md/#222-how-to-use-the-material-editors).
#### 3.4.3.4. initWorld
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function initializes the world map.
void initWorld(map world[WORLDROWS][WORLDCOLS], char solide[SOLIDCOUNT], char walkablee[WALKABLECOUNT], string fileName)
{
	//   First we get a temporary variable we can read characters into and check for
	// different things.
	char cahr;
	
	//   Next we open the file.
	freopen(fileName.c_str(),"r",stdin);
	
	//   After that we start looping through the characters in the .txt file.
	for (int i = 0; i < WORLDROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < WORLDCOLS; j++)
		{
			//   We read the next character into cahr.
			cin>>cahr;
			
			//   We check if the character we read was an 'i'.
			if (cahr == 'i')
			{
				//   If the character we read was an 'i' we set the texture of the cell
				// to a ' ' character.
				world[i][j].texture = ' ';
			}
			else
			{
				//   If the character we read wasn't an 'i' we set the texture of the
				// cell to what we read in.
				world[i][j].texture = cahr;
			}
			
			//   Next we check if the cell we just read blocks light or player movement.
			
			//   We set the .solid sub variable of the cell to false.
			world[i][j].solid = false;
			
			//   After that we start looping through all the characters that block light.
			for (int k = 0; k < SOLIDCOUNT; k++)
			{
				//   If the character we read is one of the characters that block light
				// we set the .solid sub variable of the cell to true.
				if (cahr == solide[k])
				{
					world[i][j].solid = true;
				}
			}
			
			//   We set the .walkable sub variable of the cell to false.
			world[i][j].walkable = false;
			
			//   After that we start looping through all the characters that don't block
			// movement.
			for (int k = 0; k < WALKABLECOUNT; k++)
			{
				//   If the character we read is one of the characters that don't block
				// movement we set the .solid sub variable of the cell to true.
				if (cahr == walkablee[k])
				{
					world[i][j].walkable = true;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
	//   Lastly the function closes the .txt file.
	fclose(stdin);
}
```
**Usage:** This function initializes the map of the world, with all of the important information such as textures, cells blocking light, or player movement etc. attached to each cell.

**Variables:**
* **world:** This array will hold all of the important information about each cell of the map of the game.
* **soldie:** This array holds all of the characters that block light, and thus create shadows.
* **walkablee:** This array holds all of the characters that don't block player movement.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the world.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/maps/world.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** Firstly the function opens [the world.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/maps/world.txt). Then it starts looping through each character. If the character is an 'i' the function replaces it with a ' ' character for the texture (click [here](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/2.2.%20How%20to%20use%20the%20editors%2C%20and%20other%20further%20details.md/#2231-how-to-use-the-map-editor) if you want to find out why this is). Then the function loops through both the solid and walkable characters, and sets the correct attributes of [the structure](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.2.%20Structures.md/#322-map) to the correct values.

#### 3.4.3.5. initFOV
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This function initializes a FOV array.
void initFOV(fov dir[FOVROWS][FOVCOLS], string fileName)
{
	//   First we get a temporary variable we can read characters into and check for
	// different things.
	char cahr;
	
	//   Next we open the file.
	freopen(fileName.c_str(),"r",stdin);
	
	//   After that we start looping through the characters in the .txt file.
	for (int i = 0; i < FOVROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < FOVCOLS; j++)
		{
			//   We read the next character into cahr.
			cin>>cahr;
			
			//   We check if the character we read was an '_'.
			if (cahr == '_')
			{
				//   If the character we read was an '_' we set the .inView sub variable
				// of the cell to true.
				dir[i][j].inView = true;
			}
			else
			{
				//   If the character we read wasn't an '_' we set the .inView sub
				// variable of the cell to false.
				dir[i][j].inView = false;
			}
			
			//   We check if the character we read was an '@'.
			if (cahr == '@')
			{
				//   If the character we read was an '@' we set both the .isPlayer and
				// the .inView sub variable of the cell to true.
				dir[i][j].isPlayer = true;
				dir[i][j].inView = true;
			}
			else
			{
				//   If the character we read wasn't an '@' we set the .isPlayer sub
				// variable of the cell to false.
				dir[i][j].isPlayer = false;
			}
		}
	}
	
	//   Lastly the function closes the .txt file.
	fclose(stdin);
}
```
**Usage:** This function is used to initialize all of the [FOV arrays](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/documentation/online/3.3.%20Variables%20in%20the%20main%20.cpp%20file.md/#3316-fov-arrays).

**Variables:**
* **dir:** This array will hold all of the information about the FOV we are initializing right now. 
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to the desired FOV file.

**How it's done & notes:** First we open the desired FOV file. Then we start looping through all of the characters. According to the '_', '0' and '@' characters we set the correct sub variable of the structure to true or false.
