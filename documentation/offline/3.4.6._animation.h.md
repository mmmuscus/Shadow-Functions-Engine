#### 3.4.6.1. initNewAnimation
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine

```cpp
//   This function initalizes an anmiation.
animation initNewAnimation(animation anim, string fileName)
{
	//   First we get a temporary variable we can read characters into and check for
	// different things.
	char cahr;
	
	//   Next we open the file.
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	//   After that we read the amount of frames the animation has, the height of each
	// frame and the widht of every frame.
	fbe>>anim.frames>>anim.height>>anim.width;
	
	//   Then we set the currentFrame sub variable of the structure to 0.
	anim.currentFrame = 0;
	
	//   After all that we loop over evey cell of every frame of the animation.
	for (int g = 0; g < anim.frames; g++)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < anim.height; i++)
		{
			for (int j = 0; j < anim.width; j++)
			{
				//   We read the next character into cahr.
				fbe>>cahr;
				
				//   We check if the character we just read was an 'i'.
				if (cahr == 'i')
				{
					//   If the character we just read was an 'i' we make the texture of
					// the variable a ' ' character.
					anim.frameArray[g][i][j] = ' ';
				}
				else
				{
					//   If the character we just read wasn't an 'i' we make the texture
					// of the variable the character we just read.
					anim.frameArray[g][i][j] = cahr;
				}
			}
		}
	}

	//   Lastly the function closes the .txt file.
	fbe.close();

	return anim;
}
```

**Usage:** This function initializes a new animation from an appropriate .txt file

**Variables:**

* **anim:** This variable will hold all the relevant information about the animation.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from the main .cpp file to the .txt that contains the information about the animation.

**How it's done & notes:** First the function opens the correct file, and then reads the frames, height and the width of the animation (these numbers are at the start of the .txt file). Then for each frame it loops through a height by width chunk of characters, replaces all 'i' characters with ' ' characters and reads them into the animation variable. At the end it returns this variable. To learn more about the animation pipeline click [here](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#224-the-animation-pipeline).

#### 3.4.6.2. playAnimation
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine

```cpp
//   This function plays the animation frame by frame.
void playAnimation(char console[CONSOLEROWS][CONSOLECOLS], animation anim, int yRow, int xCol)
{
	//   The function checks if the current frame of the animation is still an existing
	// frame of the animation.	
	if (anim.currentFrame < anim.frames)
	{
		//   If the current frame does exist we loop through all the variables of the 
		// current frame of the animation.
		for (int i = 0; i < anim.height; i++)
		{
			for (int j = 0; j < anim.width; j++)
			{
				//   The function writes every variable into the correct cell (all 
				// positions being offset with yRow and xCol).
				console[yRow + i][xCol + j] = anim.frameArray[anim.currentFrame][i][j];
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Usage:** This function copies the animations current frame to the correct place in the newConsole array (which holds the information about the current to-be-rendered frame).

**Variables:**

- **console:** This array holds the current to-be-rendered frame of the console window.
- **anim:** This variable holds the information about the animation we want to play
- **yRow:** This variable determines which row will contain the first row of the animation frame.
- **xCol:** This variable determines which column will contain the first column of the animation frame

**How it's done & notes:** First the function checks if the current frame is smaller then the amount of frames in the animation. If it is then it copies the animation's current frame into the correct position into the console array. The cell in the console window with the coordinate of (yRow; xCol) will contain the upper left character of the animation frame. To learn more about the animation pipeline click [here](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#224-the-animation-pipeline). This function can only be called inside a game loop since it only "renders" one frame per call (you'll need to call [the renderConsole function](3.2._Structures.md/#327-animation) too if you want to see the results of this function on screen), as of 2.0.2. you need to externally increment the currentFrame sub variable of the correct animation, this bug will hopefully be fixed by the 3.0.0. version.
