## 3.3. Variables in [the main .cpp file](../../ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp)
### 3.3.1. playerTexture
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   The texture of the player.
const char playerTexture = '@';
```
**Usage:** This is the texture of the player character.

**Notes:** This is a constant variable because I don't think there is a reason the texture of the player should change.

### 3.3.2. screenDivisionTexture
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   The texture that divides the "screen" and "menu" parts of the console window.
const char screenDivisionTexture = '#';
```
**Usage:** This is the texture of the line that divides the console window into the "screen" and "menu" sections.

**Notes:** This is a constant character because I don't think the texture of the line should change. To learn more about this separation click [here](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#2212-the-whys-of-the-fov-editors-and-the-explanation-of-the-newscreen-and-newmenu-arrays).

### 3.3.3. is___Pressed
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   These varaibles hold the input coming from the kayboard.
bool isWPressed;
bool isSPressed;
bool isAPressed;
bool isDPressed;
bool isEPressed;
bool isEscPressed;
```
**Usage:** These variables are true on every frame the correct button (which's name is in the ___ space) is pressed.

**Notes:** You can easily get the information from more keys as well, you just need to add a new variable in [the main .cpp file](../../ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) and a new function in the [input.h](../../headers/input/input.h) and [input.cpp](../../headers/input/input.cpp) file. I plan to omit the latter from the process until the 3.0.0. update

### 3.3.4. player
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the information about the player (position/orientation).
mob player;
player.row = 31;
player.col = 45;
player.up = false;
player.down = false;
player.right = true;
player.left = false;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds all the important information about the player's location and orientation.

**Notes:** You can freely alter any of these values, but when you do please refer back to [the section explaining the mob structure](3.2._Structures.md/#321-mob), and [the one detailing possible complications if the player goes to certain parts of the map](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#2231-how-to-use-the-map-editor).

### 3.3.5. lastPlayer
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the position of the player in the last frame.
mob lastPlayer;
lastPlayer.row = player.row;
lastPlayer.col = player.col;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds information about the position of the player in the last frame.

**Notes:** For information about the mob structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#321-mob).

### 3.3.6. camera
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the position of the camera.
mob camera;
camera = camMovement(camera, player);
```
**Usage:** This variable holds information about the position of the camera.

**Notes:** The camera's position is defined by the upper left corner of the view it shows. Meaning that if `camera.row = a` and `camera.col = b` the cell that is described by the row a and column b will be the top left cell shown by the engine. Altering these variables right here will result in the camera being in a different position relative to the player only until the player is first moved. If you want to alter the camera's position to the player at all times you should change [the responsible function](3.4.2._movement.h.md/#3424-cammovement) alongside these variables (for the 3.0.0. update I plan this to be automatic, so you dont have to hard code the camera's position). If you do decide to alter the camera's relative position watch out for the complications explained right [here](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#2231-how-to-use-the-map-editor). For information about the mob structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#321-mob).

### 3.3.7. whereToCamera
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the position of where the camera should get to.
mob whereToCamera;
whereToCamera.row = camera.row;
whereToCamera.col = camera.col;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds information about the position the camera should be.

**Notes:** Since I didn't want to teleport the camera franticly every time the player changes directions, I needed a variable that holds the position of where the camera should be (this position is changing very frantically but its not visible to the player). [The function dealing with camera pan](3.4.2._movement.h.md/#3425-camerapan) brings the camera one cell closer both vertically and horizontally to its desired location on every frame. For information about the mob structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#321-mob).

### 3.3.8. playerInFov
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine

```cpp
//   This variable holds the position of the player in the current FOV array.
mob playerInFov;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds information about the player's location in the current [FOV array](#3316-fov-arrays). This position acts as an anchor between the current FOV and the map of the world. 

**Notes:** Further details about the need for this variable and the workings of it can be found in [the part discussing the usage of the FOV editors](2.2._How_to_use_the_editors,_and_other_further_details.md/#2211-how-to-use-the-fov-editors) and [the function that pastes the current FOV array into the world map](3.4.5._shadowFunctions.h.md/#3454-addfovinfotomap). For information about the mob structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#321-mob).

### 3.3.9. playerPov
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the coordinate from which the player "sees" the world.
koordinate playerPov;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds information about the point of view of the player. Its the point from which lines are cast to objects to produce the binary shading effect.

**Notes:** For information about the koordinate structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#326-koordinate).

### 3.3.10. edges
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the lines that get cast from the player to the edges of
// rectangles.
edgeLines edges;
```
**Usage:** This variable holds the two lines that are currently being cast from the player to objects that don't let light through. 

**Notes:** For information about the edgeLines structure click [here](3.2._Structures.md/#325-edgelines).

### 3.3.11. sleepTime
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   This variable holds the amount of time the engine waits inbetween every frame in 
// miliseconds.
int sleepTime = 60;
```
**Usage:** This variable is equal to the time in milliseconds between two frames.

**Notes:** Altering this variable can be done right here, no need for any extra steps. If you want to achieve 60 FPS set the value to 16. I found that animations are best played at 60 milliseconds of sleepTime, the game however is better played at 30.

### 3.3.12. isNotExit
###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
```cpp
//   If this variable gets set to false the game loop terminates.
bool isNotExit = true
```
**Usage:** While this is true the game loop gets called.

**Notes:** When the escape key is pressed this is set to false, that final loop still gets processed even after pressing the escape key.

### 3.3.13. isIntro

###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine

```cpp
//   If this variable gets set to false the intro part of the game loop stops and the
// game part of the game loop begins.
bool isIntro = true;
```

**Usage:** While this is true [the "intro" part of the game loop](2._How_to_use_the_engine_and_2.1._How_the_engine_works.md/#2121-the-intro) gets called (this part only plays the intro animation).

**Notes:** When the 'E' key is pressed the game loop moves on from the intro onto the actual game.

### 3.3.14. oldConsole

###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.2. version of the engine
